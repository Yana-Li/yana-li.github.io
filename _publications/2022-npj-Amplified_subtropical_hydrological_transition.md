excerpt: 'The rainy season over southern China (SC) begins with the onset of the South China Sea monsoon around mid-May. We
demonstrate here that the SC precipitation exhibits a notable drying (wetting) trend prior to (after) the monsoon onset, leading to a more abrupt thus amplified hydrological transition over SC in early summer. The contrasting precipitation trends are largely driven by the recent decline in mid-latitude synoptic eddy activity. Weakened mid-latitude synoptic disturbances suppress SC frontal activities before the monsoon onset, facilitating the drying trend, and enhance the spatial stationarity of the SC monsoonal front after the monsoon onset, leading to the wetting trend. CMIP6 models in general fail to capture the contrasting trends between the two periods. In models where both the trends in precipitation and mid-latitude synoptic eddy activity are well captured, the amplification of the hydrological transition over SC is projected to continue well into the late 21st century. Our results highlight the footprints of hemispheric-scale climate change in regional hydroclimate and the obvious challenges faced by climate models in capturing such footprints.'

# Amplifying Subtropical Hydrological Transition Over Southern China

The article, *"Amplifying subtropical hydrological transition over China in early summer tied to weakened mid-latitude synoptic disturbances"* by Li et al. (2022), published in *npj Climate and Atmospheric Science*, investigates the changing precipitation patterns in southern China (SC) during early summer. The study reveals a drying trend before the South China Sea summer monsoon onset (mid-May) and a wetting trend afterward, driven by a decline in mid-latitude synoptic eddy activity. This results in an amplified hydrological transition, with reduced frontal activity pre-monsoon and more stationary monsoonal fronts post-monsoon. Using CMIP6 models, the authors project that this trend may persist into the late 21st century, highlighting the regional impacts of global climate change and challenges in climate modeling. This work underscores the need for improved preparedness for extreme weather events in this socioeconomically critical region.

## Key Figures

### Figure 1: Contrasting Precipitation Trends
![Figure 1](images/paper-2022-npj/Fig1.png)
*Caption*: Precipitation trends over southern China during 1979–2018 for (a) pre-monsoon onset (1 April–15 May) and (b) post-monsoon onset (16 May–30 June), with (c) time series of precipitation anomalies. (Source: Li et al., 2022)
*Explanation*: This figure illustrates the opposing precipitation trends in southern China during early summer. Before the monsoon onset (pre-MO), precipitation decreases (drying trend), while after the onset (post-MO), it increases (wetting trend). The time series (c) shows these trends over 1979–2018, highlighting an abrupt shift in rainfall patterns that amplifies the hydrological transition in the region.

### Figure 2: Frontal Activity Trends
![Figure 2](images/paper-2022-npj/Fig2.png)
*Caption*: Trends in accumulated frontal activity (FA) during (a) pre-monsoon and (b) post-monsoon periods, with time series of (c) FA index and (d) front stationarity (FS) index over southern China. (Source: Li et al., 2022)
*Explanation*: Figure 2 shows how frontal activity influences precipitation trends. In the pre-MO period (a, c), declining frontal activity due to weaker mid-latitude disturbances reduces rainfall. In the post-MO period (b, d), increased front stationarity (fronts lingering longer) enhances rainfall, as stable fronts produce prolonged precipitation events, contributing to the wetting trend.

### Figure 4: Mid-Latitude Synoptic Disturbances
![Figure 4](images/paper-2022-npj/Fig3.png)
*Caption*: Regression and trends of 2–8-day filtered sea level pressure (SLP) and 500-hPa geopotential height against southern China precipitation for (a, c) pre-monsoon and (b, d) post-monsoon periods. (Source: Li et al., 2022)
*Explanation*: This figure links precipitation changes to mid-latitude synoptic disturbances (short-term weather systems). In the pre-MO period (a, c), stronger disturbances are associated with more rainfall, but their weakening trend reduces precipitation. In the post-MO period (b, d), weaker disturbances allow stationary fronts to persist, increasing rainfall. The figure highlights how declining synoptic activity drives the observed drying and wetting trends.

### Figure 6: Future Projections in CanESM5
![Figure 6](images/paper-2022-npj/Fig4.png)
*Caption*: Projected changes in (a, b) precipitation and (c, d) synoptic disturbances (SLP and 500-hPa geopotential height) for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods in the CanESM5 model under SSP5-8.5 (2065–2100 vs. 1979–2014). (Source: Li et al., 2022)
*Explanation*: Figure 6 presents future projections from the CanESM5 model, showing a continued drying trend in the pre-MO period (a) and a wetting trend in the post-MO period (b) under a high-emissions scenario. These trends are tied to changes in synoptic disturbances (c, d), with suppressed activity in the pre-MO period reducing rainfall and weaker disturbances in the post-MO period enhancing stationary fronts, suggesting the hydrological transition will intensify by 2100.
