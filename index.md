# What We are Interested In
The primary interest of our group is climate variability on timescales ranging from a few weeks to several decades. Employing a suite of diagnostic and modeling tools, we seek to understand the origin, dynamical interactions, and regional water, energy an hazard implications of major modes of variability in the Earth’s climate system, with a special goal to elucidate the role played by extratropical, sub-monthly-scale atmospheric disturbances. 

A non-exhaustive list of current research topics in our group:

1. atmospheric scale-interaction and water/energy cycle extremes
1. subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction and predictability
1. regional and global numerical modeling
1. application of artificial intelligence in downscaling and S2S prediction
1. feedback processes in natural modes of variability and forced climate change
