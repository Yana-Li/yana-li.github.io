# What We are Interested In

The primary interest of our group is climate variability on timescales ranging from a few weeks to several decades. Employing a suite of diagnostic and modeling tools, we seek to understand the origin, dynamical interactions, and regional water, energy and hazard implications of major modes of variability in the Earth's climate system, with a special goal to elucidate the role played by extratropical, sub-monthly-scale atmospheric disturbances.
